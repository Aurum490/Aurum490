### ðŸ‘‹ Hi , I'm Aurum!

I'm a student who enjoys graphic design, coding and producing!

[JaxCore](https://github.com/Jax-Core/JaxCore) is my passion project, which originates from my desire for good-looking customizable UI on Windows, which is very lacking to this day, even with Windows 11. Also check out the [website](https://jaxcore.app/)!

The support and appreciation I've received along the way motivate me to keep going and improve the user experience. So don't hesitate to message me about anything!

Some of my far future goals are to learn front-end web development and to be able to make JaxCore standalone!

**Join my discord server** for development and release updates!
